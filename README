 	Special thanks to John Weis for lending a hand!
	
	Dev notes:
	There are some default settings for the text to display, the css classes, attributes and the counter
	
	I was using $anchor.replaceWith($labelText); to swap out elements. That works fine
	as a static script, but within the plugin those elements are not recognized when the click
	function is called because they aren't in the DOM yet. AppendTo is the correct way in this
	case.
